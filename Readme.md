# My programing language
This is my first attempt of creating a "toy programing language" from scratch. It is an interpreted language in which everything is an expression

# Futures
These are main futures i want to support in the language.
- math expressions
- variables
- lists
- conditional logic with ifs
- while & for loops
- functions

# Examples
TBD
