# My programing language
This is my first attempt of creating a "toy programing language" from scratch. It is an interpreted language in which everything is an expression

# Futures
These are main futures i want to support in the language.
- math expressions
- variables
- lists
- conditional logic with ifs
- while & for loops
- functions

# Usage
To run the interpreter type
```bash
./target <command> <filepath>
```
where commands stands for: `tokenize|parse|eval|run` and the filepath points to the file with the code
> You can always run help command or put the -h --help flag to see details

# Examples
TBD
